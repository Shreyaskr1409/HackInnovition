                strength, improving endurance, and enhancing mental clarity.</p>

            <h2>Calisthenics</h2>
            <p>Calisthenics is a form of exercise that uses the bodyâ€™s own weight for resistance. It involves a variety
                of movements that target large muscle groups, promoting strength, flexibility, endurance, and
                coordination. Unlike weight training, calisthenics requires little to no equipment, making it accessible
                and versatile for anyone, anywhere. Popular calisthenic exercises include push-ups, pull-ups, squats,
                and lunges, all of which can be adapted to match any fitness level.</p>

            <div class="benefits-of-calisthenics">
                <h3>Benefits of Calisthenics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Full-Body Workout:</strong> Calisthenics engages multiple muscle groups at once, leading
                        to
                        a balanced and comprehensive workout that enhances overall strength and fitness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Flexibility:</strong> Many calisthenic exercises require a full range of
                        motion,
                        which helps improve flexibility and joint mobility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Muscle Strength and Endurance:</strong> Regular practice builds muscular
                        strength
                        and endurance, supporting better performance in both everyday tasks and athletic activities.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Core Stability:</strong> Calisthenics often involves exercises that stabilize
                        and
                        strengthen the core, which is essential for balance, posture, and overall body control.</li>
                    <li><strong>Versatility and Convenience:</strong> Since calisthenics requires little to no
                        equipment, it
                        can be performed anywhere, from your living room to the park. This makes it a convenient option
                        for
                        those with busy schedules or limited access to a gym.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Without the need for expensive gym memberships or equipment,
                        calisthenics is a cost-effective way to stay fit.</li>
